	\section{Programming Cyber Physical Systems: Introduction}\label{sec:1} %(3pp)

         CPS = communication, computation, and control

        \section{Models} %(3pp)

        \subsection{Control theory}

         Control theory approach (plant model and feedback controller)

         \subsection{Hybrid/Timed Automata}

         \subsection{Process Algebra}

         \subsection{Dynamic Logic}

         \subsection{Markov Processes}

         \section{Communication} %(4pp)

         \subsection{Synchronous rendez-vous communication}

         fits well with automata models, good abstraction for slow dynamics and fast

         \subsection{Actor Model}

         \subsection{Functional Reactive Programming}

         communication using streams

         \subsection{Session Types}

         % cvarela:  really needed here?  or just a ref to chapter 2?

         \subsection{Networked Control System}

         centralized vs distributed controller

         \section{Communication Imperfection and Control} %(2pp)

         analogous to consistency question in distributed system but about the freshness of physical informations

         \subsection{Clock synchronization}

         a basis on which other functionality are built

         \subsection{Robustness against perturbation of communication}

         example: work on Skorokhod Distance by Ichiro Hasuo

         \subsection{Efficient use of communication}

         example: work by Sebastian Trimpe on event triggered and wireless control systems

         \subsection{Interpolation and extrapolation}

         example: tfs2 ROS library use timestamped messages to interpolate/extrapolate data

         \section{Impact of the Physical Layer and the Communication} %(2pp)

         \subsection{Point-to-point vs broadcast communication}

         \subsection{Large number of processes}

         swarm / sensor networks

         \subsection{Line-of-sight / limited range}

         gossip protocol

         \section{Open Research Questions} %(2-5pp)

         \subsection{Discrete vs continuous systems}

         Process algebra, actors, and others model discrete systems.
         Differential equations, calculus, and others model the physical world.

         \begin{itemize}
         \item How to incorporate continuous time and space into concurrency models?
         \item How to go beyond bi-simulation and observational equivalence to reason about continuous systems?
         \end{itemize}
         
         \subsection{Hardware/Software interface}

         Cyber-physical systems have a hardware (physical) and a software (cyber) component
        
         \begin{itemize}
         \item How to model SW/HW interface?
         \item Are real-time properties properly modeled?
         \item  How to tackle complexity via abstraction without losing key properties?  (Translucency vs black box approaches)
         \item How to verify infinite-space systems?
         \end{itemize}

         \subsection{Dealing with uncertainty}

         Stochastic nature of cyber-physical systems, e.g., weather, requires probabilistic approach.
        
         \begin{itemize}
         \item Are heterogeneous latencies, failure modes properly accounted for?
         \item How to accurately model, quantify, propagate uncertainty?
         \item Need for statistical reasoning libraries suitable for interactive/automated proof assistants.
         \end{itemize}

         \subsection{Modal logics and reasoning}
        
         \begin{itemize}
         \item  Is first-order logic sufficient to reason about cyber-physical systems?
         \item Are spatial logics, temporal logics, and combinations thereof better suited for specifying and reasoning about CPS?
         \item What are their expressive power?   Are there efficient decision procedures?  (SAT modulo theory approaches?)
         \end{itemize}

         \subsection{Robust control}

         Can we reason about properties of feedback loop control systems incorporating the above (hybrid, SW/HW/Network, uncertainty/failures, modal logics/reasoning)?
         
         \subsection{AI and data-driven systems}

         As more CPS are model-driven and more models are data-driven, how can we trust these systems?  Are there inherent theoretical limits to dynamic data-driven applications and systems? (e.g., Cramer-Rao lower bounds, etc.)
